# Neuroplant-DataAnalysis -- README in production
This repository contains all of the code written to perform the data analysis for the Neuroplant methods manuscript.

**Note** Any files that start with "dep_" are depricated versions of files. I will remove these once I am fully confident they do not contain usefull chunks of code

### Manuscript plots
<p> Contains the code used to generate all of analysis plots for the NP screening manuscript </p>

### S1
<p> Contains all of the code used to analyze the data from Screen 1 testing the N2 behavioral response to 96 conditions. It also contains the analysis for follow up screens using the CX10, PR678 and GN1077 mutant lines.

### MS1
<p> This folder contains the code used to analyze the dataset generated from our "Mock Screen." This screen assessed the response of N2 animals against each of our reference compounds. The dataset contains 16 technical replicates for each test condition. All images were analyzed using the OWL.</p>

### OWL performance analysis
<p>The contents include 2 performance analyses of the OWL performed in Spring 2021 and Spring 2022.</p>

### Screen development
<p> This contains code used to analyze the data from all previous iterations of the screening pipeline. There is more detail about the contents of this folder in the README found inside. </p>
